Instructions for TMBF tryout image.

First place the following files on an accessible tftp server:

1.  imagefile-rootfs.cpio.gz
2.  uImage-libera-2.6.30.10-dls

Now connect a serial console to the target Libera TMBF, reboot the target and
interrupt the boot at the u-boot prompt.  At the boot prompt use the command
printenv to check that the following variables have sensible settings:

    ipaddr=172.23.252.9
    netmask=255.255.240.0
    gatewayip=
    ethaddr=00:D0:50:31:02:43
    hostname=xcep
    serverip=172.23.240.2

Now cut and paste the four commands in boot-script in turn:

    tftpboot a0001000 uImage-libera-2.6.30.10-dls
    tftpboot a2000000 imagefile-rootfs.cpio.gz
    setenv bootargs console=ttyS0,115200 ...
    bootm a0001000

Note: please copy these commands from boot-script rather than this file.

Libera TMBF will now boot.  It will take a couple of minutes for the FPGA
loading script to complete, after which TMBF will be running.

Note that the network configuration in the tryout system is taken from the
u-boot network configuration.
