Notes for a TMBF at i-Tech
==========================

Talk for 10th April 2014, 25 minutes, to audience of Libera and related product
users.


Themes and Ideas
================



Acknowlegements and TMBF history
--------------------------------

* Initial version from Graham Naylor at the ESRF, late 2005 (Simulink / Matlab
  System Generator)

* From early 2006 to late 2013 version written by Isa Uzun (System Verilog)

* Guenther Rehm


Platform and Architecture
-------------------------

Describe Libera TMBF: bare platform, fast ADCs, FPGA, DAC, SBC, fast RAM,
wrapper interface in FPGA.

System development in System Verilog within framework provided by iTech.


Introduction to Transverse MultiBunch Feedback
----------------------------------------------

Describe what tunes are.  Can draw a diagram of betatron oscillations.

Importance of measuring tunes.

Effect of fill patterns.

Instabilities and using feedback to control them.


TMBF Improvement Project
------------------------

Main goals:

* More control over individual bunches

* Complex measurement experiments

* Tune following as a new form of tune measurement


Implementation Notes
--------------------
