\title{ARCHITECTURE OF TRANSVERSE MULTI-BUNCH FEEDBACK PROCESSOR AT DIAMOND}
\author{M.G.~Abbott, G.~Rehm, I.S.~Uzun, Diamond Light Source, Oxfordshire, UK}
\maketitle


\begin{abstract}

We describe the detailed internal architecture of the Transverse Multi-Bunch
Feedback processor used at Diamond for control of multi-bunch instabilities and
measurement of betatron tunes.  Bunch by bunch selectable control over
feedback filters, gain and excitation allows fine control over feedback,
allowing for example the single bunch in a hybrid or camshaft fill pattern to
be controlled independently from the bunch train.  It is also possible to
excite all bunches at a single frequency while simultaneously sweeping the
excitation for tune measurement of a few selected bunches.  The single
frequency excitation has been used for continuous measurement of the
beta-function.  A simple programmable event sequencer provides support for up
to 7 steps of programmable sweeps and changes to feedback and excitation,
allowing a variety of complex and precisely timed beam characterisation
experiments including grow-damp measurements in unstable conditions and
programmed bunch cleaning.  Finally input and output compensation filters
allow for correction of front end and amplifier phasing at higher frequencies.

\end{abstract}



\section{Introduction}

At Diamond Light Source (DLS) we have been using a Transverse Multi-Bunch
Feedback (TMBF) system based on the Libera hardware platform~\cite{libera} for
nearly a decade~\cite{dipac2007, epac2008, biw2010, icalepcs2011} to control
multibunch instabilities.  With a new bunch position every 2\,ns it is
appropriate for the feedback processing to be implemented in an FPGA.  The
original firmware was based on work done at the ESRF~\cite{epac2006}, but
subsequently the firmware and control system have been rewritten to provide
further extensions to the system functionality~\cite{ibic2013, ibic2014}.  This
work has extended the lifetime of the original platform and increased its
capability, and the DLS TMBF system has now been adopted at ALBA~\cite{ibic2015}
and is being evaluated at the Australian Synchrotron.

In this paper we expand on and update the original IBIC 2013~\cite{ibic2013}
paper with many system refinements.



\section{Overview}

Instrumentation Technologies Libera platform with the control system running
EPICS on an embedded Single Board Controller (SBC).
}
\label{system}
\end{figure}


Figure \ref{context} shows the TMBF processors in context.  A 4-button electrode
assembly together with an RF hybrid circuit picks up the horizontal and vertical
position of each bunch.  An RF front end converts this raw 3rd harmonic signal
into a 250\,MHz bandwidth bunch position signal suitable for processing by TMBF.
This signal is digitised at 500\,MHz (using four 125\,MHz ADCs phased at 2\,ns
intervals), processed by the FPGA, and then reconverted to drive the striplines.

The position of each bunch oscillates at the machine betatron tune, and these
oscillations can normally be suppressed by feeding them back with a phase shift
of 180\textdegree.  The TMBF measures the horizontal or vertical position of
each bunch, runs a 10-tap FIR filter on each bunch position to compute the
appropriate phase adjustment, and outputs a negative feedback signal.

The TMBF processing system consists of analogue to/from digital converters
connected to an FPGA for the high speed processing, together with memory for
data capture and an embedded Single Board Computer as shown in
Fig.~\ref{system}.

As well as the core feedback function, a number of diagnostic functions are
provided, both to enable easy monitoring of the system status, and to support
complex experiments on the beam.  System status monitoring includes detailed
overflow detection and quick measurement of beam movement.  Complex experiments
are supported by internal oscillators, detectors, and a programmable sequencer,
described in more detail below.


\begin{figure*}[t]
\begin{centering}
\input{MOPGF097f3.tikz}
\end{centering}
\caption{
This is the core data processing chain in the TMBF processor.  Data processing
starts by adding a DC offset to each of the four ADC channels to compensate for
static ADC errors, followed by a 3-tap filter to compensate for high frequency
phase errors in the front end.  The minimum and maximum value per bunch of both
the ADC and DAC streams is captured for display.  A 10-tap filter with
programmable gain (in 6\,dB steps) is applied in turn to each bunch in the ring.
The output multiplexer adds any combination of its three inputs, which is then
scaled by a bunch specific gain.  Finally an output pre-emphasis filter corrects
for amplifier errors and is followed by a delay line to correctly close the
loop.
}
\label{data_chain}
\end{figure*}


\section{Feedback Data Processing}

The main function of TMBF is to stabilise transverse oscillations of the beam.
This is done by running a separate 10-tap FIR on the position of each of the
stored bunches.  The core data processing chain shown in Fig.~\ref{data_chain}
combines this feedback with up to two optional Numerically Controlled Oscillator
(NCO) outputs.

Note that numerical overflow can occur at any stage in this processing chain.
When this is detected, a saturated output is generated and the resulting
overflow event is reported to the user through the EPICS interface.


\subsection{ADC data in}

The Libera platform uses four separate 125\,MHz ADCs to sample the 500\,MHz
bunch position signal, and so the ADC input arrives as four parallel streams of
125\,MHz data.  The first processing step is to compensate for small DC offsets
between the ADCs.  These offsets are easily measured and compensated.

The next step is to compensate for gain differences and high frequency phase and
gain errors in the front end.  This is done by running a channel dependent 3-tap
filter on the input data stream.

Finally a ``min/max'' subunit measures the minimum and maximum compensated value
for each bunch; this is read out at 100\,ms intervals and used to provide an
accessible overview of bunch motion.


\subsection{FIR feedback processing}

Next a 10-tap FIR is run on the stream from each bunch.  In practice, this means
that 936 separate FIRs are run, with a delay of 936 bunches between each tap.
The FIR unit can be programmed with four different filters, each of which can be
separately selected for each bunch.  The filter taps and final output gain are
statically configured through the EPICS interface.

The ability to control bunches independently has two main uses: firstly, it can
be used to apply a different filter to the isolated bunch in a hybrid fill;
secondly, it can be useful as part of detailed machine physics experiments.


\subsection{DAC data out}

Finally the filtered signal is prepared for output.  At this point three
candidate output signals are selected and summed together: the FIR filtered
signal and two internally generate NCO signals.  Each of these three signals can
be output or set to zero, and this control is per bunch.

Next the summed output is scaled by a bunch specific scaling factor.  As this is
signed it can be used to reverse the orientation of feedback on a single bunch.

Finally an output pre-emphasis filter is run to compensate for amplifier effects
and the output is delayed so that the complete loop delay is a full machine
revolution.

In the same way for ADC data, a ``min/max'' component measures the movement of
each output bunch over a measurement interval of 100\,ms, providing a quick view
of bunch output motion.

to be active.  Each bank contains bunch configuration information for each of
the stored bunches, used to control filtering and output configuration.
}
\label{bunch}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Bunch by Bunch Control}

As noted above, the FIR filter, the output sum, and the final output gain are
selected per bunch.  The ``Bunch Select'' unit, see Fig.~\ref{bunch}, stores
four arrays (or ``banks'') of bunch specific configurations --- one
configuration is selected by the sequencer unit (described below), and the
current bunch configuration advances on each bunch.  This configuration can be
written through the EPICS interface.

separate FIR filter selected for each bunch, and out through the DAC with the
option of adding up to two internally generated sine waves.  The other paths are
for control and data capture.  The SBC interface controls and communicates with
all other components of the system: the EPICS interface is through this
component.

\label{overview}
\end{figure*}


\section{Extra Diagnostic Data Processing}

Figure~\ref{overview} shows the complete DLS TMBF firmware.  The ADC-FIR-DAC
chain has been described above.  The remaining major components are for extra
diagnostics and advanced machine experiments.

\subsection{Data Capture}

As already shown, min/max overview data is available for ADC input and DAC
output.  The Data Capture unit allows more detailed information: up to 4096
bunches of two out of three of DAC/FIR/ADC data streams can be captured, or up
to 64 million bunches (more than 65,000 turns) of any one input can be captured.
The shorter data capture is to FPGA block memory, the larger to external DDR2
RAM.

An alternative capture source is detector IQ data from either of the two NCO
units.  In particular, this is used for tune sweeps and more complex machine
experiments.


\begin{figure}[hbt]
\begin{centering}
\input{MOPGF097f6.tikz}
\end{centering}
\caption{
The oscillator NCO\textsubscript1, can be set to a fixed frequency, or
can be used as part of a tune tracking phase locked loop.  The tune phase $\phi$
is measured at the operating frequency $f$ and used to compute a sequence of
frequency corrections $\delta\!f$ to maintain the phase error $\delta\phi$ at
zero.  The reference phase and frequency are configured via EPICS.
}
\label{nco1}
\end{figure}


\subsection{NCO\textsubscript1 and Tune PLL}

Figure~\ref{nco1} shows the first NCO unit together with the tune tracking
application (Tune PLL).  When tune tracking is inactive the NCO generates a
fixed frequency sine wave with programmable gain which can be used to drive
selected bunches.

When tune tracking is active the detector (see Fig.~\ref{nco2} for the detector
structure) measures the phase response of the beam at the currently driven
frequency and runs a simple PI feedback loop to adjust the frequency to keep the
phase response static.  The frequency shift can be read as a continuous stream
through the EPICS interface.

This is very useful for measuring rapid changes in the machine betatron
frequency, but will only work when the centre frequency and phase are already
known to sufficient precision.  Measuring this is the primary job of the next
unit.



\begin{figure}[hbt]
\begin{centering}
\input{MOPGF097f7.tikz}
\end{centering}
\caption{
The oscillator NCO\textsubscript2 is under control of the sequencer, and is only
enabled while the sequencer is running a program.  The sequencer controls the
NCO frequency and gain and performs programmed frequency sweeps.  Data from the
beam is mixed with the excitation waveform  in the detector to measure a
complete complex IQ response.  Operation of this system produces a waveform of
IQ measurements which can be used for measuring betatron tune and other machine
parameters.
}
\label{nco2}
\end{figure}

\subsection{NCO\textsubscript2 and the Sequencer}

Figure~\ref{nco2} shows the second NCO unit together with the sequencer unit and
a detailed view of the detector.  The detector measures the complex response of
the selected input to the driving frequency.  The duration of each measurement
is controlled by the sequencer.  The measured IQ value is scaled to a pair of
16-bit numbers for storage and transferred to the control system.

The TMBF sequencer controls the NCO\textsubscript2 frequency, the
NCO\textsubscript2 output level, and which bunch bank is currently active.  A
machine experiment is performed by programming up to seven different control
configurations and then triggering the start of the sequencer.  The sequencer
will then work its way through the programmed states, changing the output
configuration as appropriate and capturing the appropriately programmed number
of IQ samples, before finishing.  Typically the sequencer and the data capture
unit are triggered together.

For example, a standard tune sweep is performed using a single sequencer state
which configures NCO\textsubscript2 for output and steps through a preset range
of NCO frequencies.  Alternatively, a grow-damp experiment requires more states:
one to excite the beam for a selected period, one to allow the beam to grow
without feedback or excitation for a period, and one to restore feedback.

One final feature of the sequencer is the so-called ``super-sequencer'': this
repeatedly performs a sequencer programme for a series of base frequencies.
This is used to perform a grow-damp experiment on each transverse mode in turn,
and allows the transverse mode damping times to be measured for all modes in a
fraction of a second~\cite{ibic2014}.


\section{EPICS Control System}

The control system running on the embedded ARM processor was developed
concurrently with the FPGA firmware, and provides access to all settings and
readings through around 560 EPICS PVs.  A number of supporting scripts were
written in Python and Matlab to help configure some of the more complex
functions of TMBF.

A complete set of user interface screens built using EDM provides access to
every PV published by TMBF.  Around 255 PVs are used to configure settings, so
the supporting scripts are important for normal operation.

The EPICS control system and the TMBF FPGA system are tightly coupled.  Although
the ARM processor is low powered and lacks hardware floating point support it is
capable of some signal processing if care is taken.  In particular, tune
measurement is done by first performing a frequency response sweep with the
FPGA, and then analysing the resulting IQ response and fitting a multi-pole tune
response model.  It has been possible to develop quite a sophisticated tune
measurement process on this system.


\section{Conclusions}

The upgraded TMBF system described here has been in use at Diamond since late
2013 and is allowing us to perform very complex measurements to characterise the
beam behaviour.  This development has pushed the 10 year old FPGA technology to
its limits, the FPGA now has little or no room for further developments.

Our next step at Diamond is to implement longitudinal bunch-by-bunch feedback in
preparation for operation with normally conducting cavities.  This will be based
on a more modern FPGA on industry standard MicroTCA hardware.
