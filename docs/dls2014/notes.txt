Present description of flip-flops.  This is worth several slides.  Talk about
the fundamental behaviour of a clocked D-type flip-flop (also known as a
register).  Also talk about metastiblity and consequences when trying to cross
between different clocks.

Register interface.  Write-only registers are a sensible use of resources.
Reading is surprisingly expensive because of multiplexors.

Pipelining.  Explain the detector accumulator, we have quite a nice diagram of
how it is pipelined.

Complain about languages, critique SV.
