CROSS_COMPILER_TARGET_ARCHS += linux-arm
#       Typically targets Libera systems with firmware 1.46 to 1.82,
#       targeting glibc 2.3.2 on Libera.  The recommended build here is to
#       use gcc 3.4.4 and glibc 2.3.6 -- this toolchain was built using
#       crosstool.
#
# CROSS_COMPILER_TARGET_ARCHS += linux-arm_el
#       Targets newer Libera systems using the ARM "embedded" EABI.  At 
#       Diamond we target glibc 2.7 using gcc 4.3.2 with a toolchain built
#       using crosstool-ng, however there is no reason not to use this target
#       with the standard iTech toolchain.

#    Note: if the IOC builder is not installed, please place the prebuilt .db
# files in the liberaApp/Db directory to avoid any need to invoke this.
